![Use of Insecticide treated mosquitoe Net in Africa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carineammons/my_data_analyst_project/main/MalariaPlot%20(2).png)

 The amount of Tent used in Africa countries to control the spread of mosquitoes.Malaria has been causing a lot of dead in Africa. The most effcetive way malaria can be reduce is through the use of ITN.
 
 
 MOTIVATION:
 
 What motivated me about the topic I chose for this project is that my country Malaria was a big deal when I was in Cameroon. A lot of people lost their lives from contracting Malaria. Newborns were getting sick and dying from Malaria. People started using insecticides to spray around their houses for the prevention of mosquitoes. I was not comfortable with insecticide sprays around kids. We started using tenet when I was still back home, but due to limited information, I was not sure how well tents could be of great use in the protection against Malaria. It was fulfilling to do this project finding out that TEN use is a great way to prevent Malaria.                                                                                                                                                                                


DATA SOURCE
I collected my data from UNICEF. Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa have made considerable progress in household ownership of ITNs/LLINs in recent years, with an average coverage of 69 per cent. However, ownership is uneven across countries, ranging from 31 per cent in Angola to approximately 97 per cent in Guinea-Bissau. In addition, only 35 per cent of households had sufficient ITNs for all household members, which is drastically short of universal access to this preventive measure.




Processing Steps

I started by wanting to use the data of how many percentages of people per country in sub-Sahara Africa got infected with Malaria. This data was not completed because it did not come with headings. I added headers to it, but I changed my mind to go with Malaria is control in Africa by the use of Tent. The data I used came with a .csv file.


VIsualization
looking at my visualization since 2007, the percentage of children sleeping under ITNs in sub-Saharan Africa increased from less than 40 per cent to over 50 per cent. But despite recent progress in sub-Saharan Africa, the overall use of treated mosquito nets falls short of the global target of universal coverage, and many children are not benefiting from this potentially life-saving intervention.




Analysis

Looking at the data  what i called life saving intervention has been of great help to the population of Africa. Poeple are still suffering from malaria, but early diagnosis and treatment are essential for more favourable malaria outcomes.
